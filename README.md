## JS Frontend Test: Waldo Frontend API

This test requires the developer to build an interface using HTML & JS to display and navigate a set of records that can be retreived via a small API.

The API is based at `https://tools.hiwaldo.com/hiring/` and accepts `GET` requests from any location.

An access key is required to access which is passed via the `key` parameter :

> Access Key: wkbHE5F94aJRUJmE924DW4KBayrxWQ3q6LY8dtKf9PV

The API outputs 10 records per page.  The pageset can be retrieved by passing the `page` parameter with the desired page ie:

> &page=2

There are 200 records in total.
